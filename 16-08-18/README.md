Each member of 3 groups of 5 where tasked with reading 1 of 3 chapters from the second devops book, then they would discuss the its content and afterwards 5 groups of three where each groupmember had read a diffrent section would sit together and based on a case-study 

# Keypoints of the day


# Case-study points

> If no versionconrol system is used suggest git
>
> > Do not suggest git if a version-control-system is already in use it may cause more harm than good migrating from an existing version control system

> Next suggest a CI tool such as jenkins that allows the company to run jobs
>
> > Jobs could start out as being an automation of the unit tests and go from there into a more sophisticated pipeline

> Next if the company wishes to move further into devops suggest tools such as vagrant and puppet to automate a build pipeline, vagrant for setting up environments and puppet to install software into the environments

> last but no least talk about doing acceptance testing, this should be done by the `devops` team which creates a `DOD (definition of done)`
> and then features can be implemented and tested based on these definitions, this will make the running of the overall pipeline much smoother and more error will be caught.
