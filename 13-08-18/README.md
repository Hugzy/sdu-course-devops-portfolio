# Log of the day

The first half of the day was spent mostly on introductoy stuff, these included

-   Course curicilum
-   Who the instructors were
-   Who the students were
-   What the exam would be like
-   What we could expect to gain from the course
-   And general information regarding the coming two weeks lectures

In the second half the students (us), were asked to build structures of lego in small teams and within iterations or `scrum sprints`, there where in total 3 groups consisting of 5 group members. Before each iteration which lasted 5 minutes the group was give 5 minutes to evaluate current progress and if any new tasks could be added to current sprints todolist, (note a task should only be taken on if it is expected that it would be finished aswell)

# Keypoints of the day

## Breakdown barriers between testers, developers and operations

## The book is very concise about automating everything

## Reduce time from E2E

## It is important to split the responsibility of a feature between multiple group members, to reduce a single point of failure e.g. if a groupmember with all the knowledge af a feature leaves the group.

## Adding new members during stressfull times is counterproductive

## Generally expect that you can do less than what you think

-   This is experience gained after trying to measure how much time a task would take a repeatedly failing

## Always make sure that you consult the product owner (PO)

## Requirements will change so plan for it
